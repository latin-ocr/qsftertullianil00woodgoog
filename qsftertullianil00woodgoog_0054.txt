and the existing habits of belief or disbeliel. He insiste ciiip’
particularly on the probability there is that truth is not -⁰—-
discoverable at all, and infers the obligation thus im·
posed by prudence of acquiesciug in things as they are,
especially as under such regimen fortune and dominion
· had rewarded Roman piety: he ridiculas the ideas of
the future destruction of the world, and the resurrection
of the body: and after commenting severely both ou
the real and the credited practices of the Christiana, he
concludes that they are throwing away all the tangible
pleasures of this life, for the uncertain remunerations of
another. Itis to these statements that Octavius has to
reply‚ which he does cleverly enough, and if some of
his arguments appear borrowed, we must remember that
it was scarcely possible to avoid saying the same things
on the same subject. He states very clearly the ar·
guments for the unity of God and for the nullity of
Paganism: he shews that the end of the world and the
resurrection of the flesh are neither nehel nor incredible
tenets‚ and he defends the Christiana successfully on the
minor charges respecting their daily habits. It will be
seen on a carefirl perusal of this treatise, that it is occu-
pied in clearing away any antecedent objections to the
consideratiore of Christianity; it shews the existence of
a God, and offers proof of his unity, it demonstrates the
folly of the existing religion, and removes the superficial
objection to the new one; and its effect upon its readers

or its audience, unless they could disprove its reasoning,

must have been to convince them that there was a God
to whom their worship was due, that they'had not lrnown
him yet, and that, to say the least, there was no α priori
¹ evidence that the teaching of the despised Christiane would
not supply the knowledge.
